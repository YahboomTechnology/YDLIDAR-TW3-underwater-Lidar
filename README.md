# Introduction
YDLIDAR TW3 is the first underwater green laser LiDAR developed by EAI Tech. Based on the pulsed TOF ranging principle, it boasts an IP68 protection rating and is specifically designed for underwater environments. It can penetrate surface reflections, water refraction, and turbid water conditions to perform high-precision, high-stability underwater environment scanning. With the TW3, pool cleaning robots, underwater inspection equipment, and other devices can achieve intelligent navigation and environmental mapping capabilities. The TW3 breaks the long-standing limitations of underwater sensors, which have been restricted to infrared/cameras, enabling stable construction of high-precision point cloud maps in harsh and complex underwater environments, achieving autonomous positioning, obstacle avoidance, and path planning.
# Features
* IP68 waterproof, suitable for 5-meter water depth

  Adopts a double-layer sealed waterproof structure, with a protection rating of IP68, ensuring long-term stable operation within a 5M water depth.
* 100Klux strong light suppression technology, ranging range up to 5M
  
  Even under strong light, surface reflection, or turbid water with many suspended particles, the TW3 still operates stably, achieving underwater penetration with a maximum ranging radius of 5M.

* 360° real-time scanning, accurately reconstructing the underwater environment

  Perform 360° omnidirectional scanning and ranging detection of the surrounding environment, with a sampling frequency of 4000 times/S. Built-in motor driver with speed control function, allowing adjustment of the scanning frequency from 6Hz to 12Hz.
* Special materials resistant to chemical corrosion, offering improved durability
  
  Adopt high-performance composite materials resistant to salt, chlorine, and oxidation, fundamentally resisting harsh swimming pool chemical environments and effectively extending product life.

* Development resources & sample code, help users quickly implement projects
  Complete technical documentation will be provided, including data sheets, debugging guides, ROS1/ROS2 SDK development tutorials, 3D model files, and Windows PC debugging software. It also supports mainstream platforms such as Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson series boards, PCs, industrial computers, and RDK series boards.
